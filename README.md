# CreateX Creator

Easily deploy CreateX on any chain

## How it works

- Select your chain by inputting the correct [RPC URL](https://chainlist.org/)
- Fund the deployer account 0xeD456e05CaAb11d66C4c797dD6c1D6f9A7F352b5 with the required amount of gas. The default pre-signed transaction has a gas limit of 3,000,000 gas
- No one owns the private key to the deployer account
- Click to deploy the pre-signed transaction
- The expected CreateX address should be 0xba5Ed099633D3B313e4D5F7bdc1305d3c28ba5Ed

Deploys CreateX using one of the [pre-signed transactions](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/createx/tree/main/scripts/presigned-createx-deployment-transactions).
